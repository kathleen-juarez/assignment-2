# 1. Summarize the instructor's lecture about Quarto that you found impressive. Do you see yourself using Quarto every day for your job or studies, such as taking notes in class or preparing a presentation? More eye-catching effects will be introduced in later modules.

-   I was very impressed with all that Quarto could do. I am familiar with Quarto due to using it in other classes. I enjoy the visual mode because it makes it easy to format text and input images. However I didn't realize that there was so much more to Quarto beyond just ease of use. For instance, I was not aware that I can publish a Quarto document directly to the internet. I feel like that opens up so many options for me and I am looking forward to creating an online resume/portflio website using Quarto.

## This is a call out

This is a call out. It is one of my favorite features of Quarto, and I love that it can be made to be collapsible.

# 2. Summarize the Posit video on Quarto's capabilities.

In this video, that you need to change the YAML in Quarto to change the output. Converting a Quarto doc to render to pdf is as simple as changing the designation in the YAML.

# 3. Choose a previous class assignment in which you wrote a couple of pages. Copy it into Quarto and style it to make it nice

# 4. Publish this assignment document in an HTML file to Quarto Pub
